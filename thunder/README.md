# South Dakota State University
## "Roaring Thunder" Linux Cluster

In fall of 2018, the new SDSU Linux cluster, "thunder", became operational and is now in testing mode.  They system is housed in the Admin building (Morrill hall) data center and consists of 56 compute nodes, 5 big memory nodes, 4 gpu nodes, and 450 TB GPFS parallel file system.

In the picture above, the 450 TB DDN GPFS parallel file system is at the top of the rack on the left. The larger nodes are the specialty nodes (gpu or high memory), the main enclosures for the compute nodes (4 nodes per enclosure) are near the bottom of both racks.


## Quickstart

Documentation is currently being developed for the system.  The basics of getting connected and running a simple job are outlined here.

### Accounts

To gain access to the cluster, for now use the existing "form"
at https://www.sdstate.edu/information-technology/connecting-cluster, and put in `thunder` for the research server name.  Email the form to SDSU.HPC@sdstate.edu; CC to brian.moore@sdstate.edu and chad.julius@sdstate.edu.

### Login

The login node of the cluster is `roaringthunder.sdstate.edu`; you can also use the shorter name `rt.sdstate.edu`.  Use a terminal program (e.g. PuTTY) to make a command line connection to the login node.  When you first log in for the first time, you should see notification that a folder has been automatically created for you in the `/home` area.

### Campus Active Directory credentials

Your username and password for the system will be your current SDSU campus username and password (for example username `brian.moore`, etc.).  Use your SDSU FacStaff account if you have one--check with Support Desk if you are not sure.

If you only have a student account, your username will be the "short" version, usually one string in the pattern: first initial, middle initial, last name (for example `cajulius`).

Email us if you are having login problems after being notified of account creation:
SDSU.HPC@sdstate.edu, CC to brian.moore@sdstate.edu and chad.julius@sdstate.edu.

### Connecting to the system

On the SD State public website, we have information about connecting to the previous cluster (blackjack/bigjack); see https://www.sdstate.edu/information-technology/connecting-cluster. The first step is to initiate a terminal connection, https://www.sdstate.edu/information-technology/terminal-connection-windowsmac.  These instructions are for the previous cluster, but the procedure is the same.  For the hostname, use `rt.sdstate.edu` in place of `blackjack.jacks.local`.  One change is that for the new cluster, `rt.sdstate.edu` should be available from the campus student wireless network.

### Linux Command Line Interface (CLI)

The main way to interact with the cluster is through a remote shell terminal program, with Linux command line interface syntax.  The main tasks to master at the outset are how to manage files, folders and data from the commande line, editing text files within the terminal (using console editors such as vi or nano), interacting with the environment module system, and creating, submitting and monitoring batch jobs with the cluster job scheduler, SLURM.

We have a command line help page at https://www.sdstate.edu/information-technology/linux-command-line-documentation; also at https://github.com/sdsu-unrc/unrc_docs/blob/master/linux_command_line/linux_cmd.md with better formatting.
The material in the CLI guide still has the previous cluster for specific context/examples, but the basic approach is the same for both clusters.

### Environment modules

As on the previous cluster, we employ on thunder environment modules to load custom software.  A key reason for using the cluster (or other Linux server) is the ability to build and install new programs. This can be done either by the user, or system support staff and made available for all users.

A good place to start with environment modules is with the
`module_avail` command, which will show the list of programs.

```ShellSession
[brian.moore@login ~]$ module avail

---------------- /cm/shared/modulefiles_local ----------------------------------
   MCR/R2017b                             h5py/2.8.0
   MCR/R2018b                    (D)      hdf5/1.10.4-cuda
   NCL/6.5.0                              hdf5/1.10.4-for-netcdf
   R/3.5.1-mkl-nox11                      hdf5/1.10.4-mpich-3.3
   R/3.5.1-mkl                   (D)      hdf5/1.10.4                           
   R/3.5.1                                hdf5/1.10.4-zlib-1.2.11
   WRF/3.9.1                              hmmer/3.2.1
```
[...]

The environment modules give us a way to flexibly present different versions of software.  For example, supposing you were looking for the `scipy` module in python.  You might try the following:

```ShellSession
[brian.moore@login ~]$ python
Python 2.7.5 (default, Apr 11 2018, 07:36:10)
[GCC 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-28)] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import scipy
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ImportError: No module named scipy
>>>
```

The default system python does not have this module.  However if you load one of our local python installs, you can find it.

```ShellSession
[brian.moore@login ~]$ module load python
[brian.moore@login ~]$ python
Python 3.7.1 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 13 2018, 18:33:04)
[GCC 7.3.0] :: Anaconda, Inc. on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import scipy
>>>
```

You notice that in this case we loaded a python 3 version.  This is because there are multiple pythons in the environment modules and the python 3 version is the default, indicated by (D) in the module avail listing.  If we want a non-default module, we can explicitly ask for it.

```ShellSession
[brian.moore@login ~]$ module load python/2.7

The following have been reloaded with a version change:
  1) python/3.7 => python/2.7

[brian.moore@login ~]$ python
Python 2.7.15 |Anaconda, Inc.| (default, May  1 2018, 23:32:55)
[GCC 7.2.0] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```

Notice in the case above, the environment module system was smart enough to realize we already had a version of python loaded and it automatically unloaded the previous version. The command `module list` is good to use always before loading new modules, to see what is already loaded.  Modules can be removed with the `module unload` command.

### SLURM scheduler

The cluster has one login node (`roaringthunder`) and many identical worker nodes behind a private network switch. In our case we have 65 worker nodes (56 compute, 5 big-mem, 4 gpu).  To run on the worker nodes, we submit a batch script to the scheduler.

**Don't run long and resource intensive jobs on the login node!!  Use the login node to test your application and code, then deploy to the nodes.**

On `thunder`, the scheduler is SLURM, which is the most commonly used scheduler on HPC batch systems.  The old cluster ran Moab/PBS, a different kind of scheduler.

SLURM is open source and there are many good sources of information for it on the internet, for example at https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html.  On the schedmd site, we have found the two page summary very useful, https://slurm.schedmd.com/pdfs/summary.pdf.  An even briefer "cheat sheet" is https://www.chpc.utah.edu/presentations/SlurmCheatsheet.pdf .

Before running a job, it can be useful to do a few basic SLURM commands.  For example, `squeue` shows the state of the job queue, both running and pending jobs.

```ShellSession
[brian.moore@login ~]$ squeue
             JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
             18233      test  openmpi jeffrey.  R 1-17:18:26      5 node[020-024]
             18238      defq PLATANUS software  R 1-15:13:00      1 big-mem002
             18248      defq PLATANUS software  R 1-00:36:07      1 big-mem003
             18256      test starccm. dillon.p  R    1:44:58      6 node[001-006]
             18257      test starccm. weston.c  R      49:39      6 node[007-012]
             18258      test starccm2 weston.c  R      43:47      6 node[013-018]
```

We see there are a few jobs running, some on just a single node, some on multiple nodes.  In this case, all jobs are running, see the R status under the ST header line.  If all nodes were occupied, we might see also some jobs in pending state, PD.

The PARTITION header refers to the SLURM partition; a partition is a group of nodes.  When you submit your job, it will choose from the nodes in the partition you select (or the default partition, if you don't select).

We can see partition and node information with the `sinfo` command.

```ShellSession
[root@login lib]# sinfo
PARTITION AVAIL  TIMELIMIT  NODES  STATE NODELIST
all          up 14-00:00:0     18    mix big-mem005,node[001,006-007,009-013,021,029,031,036-037,043,054-056]
all          up 14-00:00:0     43  alloc big-mem[001-004],node[002-005,008,014-020,022-028,030,032-035,038-042,044-053]
all          up 14-00:00:0      4   idle gpu[001-004]
compute*     up 14-00:00:0     17    mix node[001,006-007,009-013,021,029,031,036-037,043,054-056]
compute*     up 14-00:00:0     39  alloc node[002-005,008,014-020,022-028,030,032-035,038-042,044-053]
bigmem       up 14-00:00:0      1    mix big-mem005
bigmem       up 14-00:00:0      4  alloc big-mem[001-004]
gpu          up 14-00:00:0      4   idle gpu[001-004]
```

The output of `sinfo` shows the partitions and what the nodes are doing in the partition; alloc means jobs running, idle means available to accept jobs.

We have four partitions configured. The default partition is compute which is why there is an asteric next to it. This partition contains 56 compute nodes that each have 40 cores and 196GB of RAM. The bigmem partition contains five nodes that each have 3TB of RAM and 80 cores. The gpu partition contains 4 GPU nodes each with 40 Cores 724GB of RAM. GPU001-003 contain 2 NVIDIA P100s and GPU004 contains 2 NVIDIA V100s. The all partition includes all the nodes.

More information about `squeue`, `sinfo` and other SLURM commands can be obtained with the Linux `man` command, for example `man sinfo`.

Other important SLURM commands are `sbatch`, to submit a SLURM job, `scancel`, and `sacct`, to see information about a job, and `srun`.

The `srun` command can be used to initiate a interactive SLURM job.

```ShellSession
[brian.moore@login ~]$ srun --partition=test --pty bash
[brian.moore@node019 ~]$
```

The `--pty` option means execute in psuedo-terminal, and `bash` is the name of the command to execute; `bash`
is the Linux command line interpreter.

In this case, your interactive job is just like a regular SLURM job, but connected to a terminal you can type commands into.  Since we have not specified otherwise, in the example above it will be given default number of processes (one), default maximum walltime, etc.  You can specify non-default values with more options on the `srun` invocation.


### Example SLURM job

For examples in general on the system, you can browse through the `/examples` folder.  Not all of these are guaranteed to work; some have been tested while others have been put there just to give a general idea.

For our example here, let's use a MATLAB example, in `/examples/matlab`.  The MATLAB script we are going to run is in the file `matrixsoln.m`.

```MATLAB
% file matrixsoln.m
% MATLAB matrix linear solution (Ax=b) problem, to illustrate multithreading.
%
A=rand(20000);
b=rand(20000,1);
tic
x=A\b;
toc
norm(A*x-b)
```

This MATLAB script creates a fairly big random vector and 2D array, and then solves the Ax=b matrix problem, using MATLAB's built in solver, which is implicitly multithreaded.  So we will request an entire compute node in our SLURM script, `matlab.slurm`

```bash
#!/bin/bash

#SBATCH --job-name=matlab       # Job name
#SBATCH --nodes=1               # Number of nodes
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=40    # CPUs per node (MAX=40 for CPU nodes and 80 for GPU)
#SBATCH --output=out-%j-%N.log  # Standard output (log file)
#SBATCH --partition=test        # Partition/Queue
#SBATCH --time=72:00:00         # Maximum walltime

module purge
module use /cm/shared/modulefiles_local
module load shared
module load slurm/17.11.8
module load matlab/R2018b
module list

date
time matlab -nodisplay < matrixsoln.m
date
```

The SLURM script is a `bash` script.  The lines with `#SBATCH` are comments to `bash` but when submitted to SLURM they are interpreted as resource requests.  Resources are things such as processors, memory, time, etc.  There are many possible resources one can request, the above script just give a simple example.

The two lines:
```bash
#SBATCH --nodes=1               # Number of nodes
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=40    # CPUs per node (MAX=40 for CPU nodes and 80 for GPU)
```

specify the nodes and tasks (processors) we want.  Since we know in this case (because of prior testing) that MATLAB will try to grab all processors, we ask for all on an node.

The `partition` selection is important, because we know we want a compute node, and if we submit to the default queue instead, we could wind up with a big-mem or gpu node and we don't want that.

The `time` specification is the maximum walltime (real, elapsed time) the running job can have.  When that time is reached, if your job is still running, it will be terminated.

After the `#SBATCH` resource request lines, we have module commands.  We load the modules we need for this job.  In general, we always want to use the first four lines of the `module` requests, then we add the specific extra modules we want for this job, matlab, in this case.

#### Running the SLURM job

To run the example, we need to create a local folder, first copy the MATLAB script and SLURM script to your own local folder.

```ShellSession
[brian.moore@login ~]$ mkdir matlabtest
[brian.moore@login ~]$ cd matlabtest/
[brian.moore@login matlabtest]$ cp /examples/matlab/matlab.slurm .
[brian.moore@login matlabtest]$ cp /examples/matlab/matrixsoln.m .
[brian.moore@login matlabtest]$ ls
matlab.slurm  matrixsoln.m
[brian.moore@login matlabtest]$
```

Now submit the job.

```ShellSession
[brian.moore@login matlabtest]$ sbatch matlab.slurm
Submitted batch job 18262
```

After submitting the job, you can use `squeue` to see if it is in the system


```ShellSession
[brian.moore@login matlabtest]$ squeue
             JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
             18233      test  openmpi jeffrey.  R 1-18:47:01      5 node[020-024]
             18238      defq PLATANUS software  R 1-16:41:35      1 big-mem002
             18248      defq PLATANUS software  R 1-02:04:42      1 big-mem003
             18256      test starccm. dillon.p  R    3:13:33      6 node[001-006]
             18262      test   matlab brian.mo  R       0:06      1 node007
```

We can see it running, job number 18262, on node007.  When it is done the complete output file will be in the folder.  Display it in the terminal with the `more` command.

### Disk quotas and policies

Each user has a folder created in `/home` upon first login, with 100 GB quota per user.
Users that need more disk space to run can request a folder be created in the scratch area, `/gpfs/scratch`, part of the GPFS shared file system.  No user quotas are implemented in scratch, but a data expiration policy will eventually be applied and older data will be deleted.  Currently, no backups are running yet. Eventually we will have tape backups on home, but not scratch.
